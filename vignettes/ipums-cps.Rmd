### Research Questions ##
What is the frequency of food stamp recipiency in the US? Are health and work
statuses related?

### Objectives

## Getting the data into R ##
To facilitate running this vignette in R, the example code here uses
the pre-made extract included in the `ripumstest` package. If you 
would like to use the extract that you have created, change the filepaths 
noted below.

```{r}
library(ripums)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(haven)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cps_ddi_file <- ripums_example("cps_00011.xml")
cps_data_file <- ripums_example("cps_00011.dat.gz")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Change these filepaths to the filepaths of your downloaded extract
cps_ddi_file <- "C:/Users/My Name/My Documents/cps_00001.xml"
cps_data_file <- "C:/Users/My Name/My Documents/cps_00001.dat"
```
```{r}
cps_ddi <- read_ddi(cps_ddi_file) # Contains metadata, nice to have as separate object
cps_data <- read_ipums_micro(cps_ddi_file, data_file = cps_data_file)
```

## Exercises ##

### Analyze the Sample – Part I Frequencies of FOODSTMP
A) On the website, find the codes page for the FOODSTMP variable
and write down the code value, and what category each code
represents. 
```{r}
# Can find on the website or from the data
print_labels(cps_data$FOODSTMP)
```
B) What is the universe for FOODSTMP in 2011 (under the
Universe tab on the website)? 
```{r}
# (Only available on website)
# All interviewed households and group quarters. 
#
# Note the NIU on the codes page, this is a household variable and the
# NIU cases are the vacant households.
```

C) How many people received food stamps in 2011? 

D) What proportion of the population received food stamps in
2011? 

```{r}
# We will be working with the FOODSTMP variable a lot, so 
# let's turn it into a factor
cps_data <- cps_data %>%
  mutate(FOODSTMP_factor = as_factor(FOODSTMP))

cps_data %>% 
  group_by(FOODSTMP_factor) %>%
  summarize(n_foodstamp = sum(WTSUPP)) %>%
  mutate(pct_foodstmp = n_foodstamp / sum(n_foodstamp))

```


### Using household weights (HWTSUPP)
Suppose you were interested not in the number of people living in
homes that received food stamps, but in the number of households
that were food stamp participants. To get this statistic you would
need to use the household weight.

In order to use household weight, you should be careful to select
only one person from each household to represent that household's
characteristics. You will need to apply the household weight
(HWTSUPP). 

A) How many households received food stamps in 2011?

B) What proportion of households received food stamps in 2011?

```{r}
cps_data %>% 
  group_by(SERIAL) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  group_by(FOODSTMP_factor) %>%
  summarize(n_foodstamp = sum(WTSUPP)) %>%
  mutate(pct_foodstmp = n_foodstamp / sum(n_foodstamp))

```

### Analyze the Sample – Part II Relationships in the Data ###
A) What is the universe for EMPSTAT in 2011?
```{r}
# Age 15+
```

B) What are the possible responses and codes for the selfreported
HEALTH variable? 
```{r}
print_labels(cps_data$HEALTH)
```

C) What percent of people with ‘poor’ self-reported health are at
work? 
```{r}
cps_data %>%
  filter(HEALTH == 5) %>%
  summarize(emp_pct = weighted.mean(EMPSTAT == 10, WTSUPP))
```

D) What percent of people with ‘very good’ self-reported health
are at work? 
```{r}
cps_data %>%
  filter(HEALTH == 2) %>%
  summarize(emp_pct = weighted.mean(EMPSTAT == 10, WTSUPP))
```

E) In the EMPSTAT universe, what percent of people:

i. self-report ‘poor’ health and are at work? 

ii. self-report ‘very good’ health and are at work? 

```{r}
pct_emp_by_health <- cps_data %>%
  filter(AGE >= 15) %>%
  mutate(HEALTH_factor = as_factor(HEALTH)) %>% 
  group_by(HEALTH_factor) %>%
  summarize(emp_pct = weighted.mean(EMPSTAT == 10, WTSUPP))

pct_emp_by_health
```

### Analyze the Sample – Part III Relationships in the Data
A) What is the universe for AHRSWORK? 
```{r}
# Civilians age 15+, at work last week
```

B) What are the average hours of work for each self-reported health
category? 
```{r}
avg_hrs_by_health <- cps_data %>% 
  filter(AGE >= 15 & AHRSWORKT < 999) %>%
  mutate(HEALTH_factor = as_factor(HEALTH)) %>% 
  group_by(HEALTH_factor) %>%
  summarize(mean_hours_worked = weighted.mean(AHRSWORKT, WTSUPP))

avg_hrs_by_health  
```

### Bonus ### 
A) Use the `ripums` package metadata features and `ggplot2` to make a
presentation-ready graph of the relationship between HEALTH and percent
employed (from Part III above).

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
library(ggplot2)

x_label <- ipums_var_label(cps_data, HEALTH)
source_info <- ipums_file_info(cps_ddi)$ipums_project

ggplot(pct_emp_by_health, aes(x = HEALTH_factor, y = emp_pct)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#00263a") + 
  scale_x_discrete(x_label) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Percent employed", labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(
    title = "Low Self-Reported Health Status Correlated with Unemployment", 
    subtitle = "Among age 15+ from CPS 2011 ASEC sample",
    caption = paste0("Source: ", source_info)
  )

```

B) Are there any variables that might be confounding this relationship? How might you explore this relationship?
```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 7}
# Age is likely correlated with self-reported health and employment, so a good 
# analysis would control for this.

# One way to do so graphically is to make faceted plots by age group
pct_emp_by_health_age <- cps_data %>%
  filter(AGE >= 15) %>%
  mutate(
    AGE_factor = cut(
      AGE, 
      c(15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, max(AGE)), 
      c("15-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", "65+"),
      include.lowest = TRUE
    ),
    HEALTH_factor = as_factor(HEALTH)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(HEALTH_factor, AGE_factor) %>%
  summarize(emp_pct = weighted.mean(EMPSTAT == 10, WTSUPP))

x_label <- ipums_var_label(cps_data, HEALTH)
source_info <- ipums_file_info(cps_ddi)$ipums_project

ggplot(pct_emp_by_health_age, aes(x = HEALTH_factor, y = emp_pct)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#00263a") + 
  scale_x_discrete(x_label) + 
  scale_y_continuous("Percent employed", labels = scales::percent) + 
  facet_wrap(~AGE_factor, ncol = 2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Low Self-Reported Health Status Correlated with Unemployment", 
    subtitle = "Among age 15+ from CPS 2011 ASEC sample",
    caption = paste0("Source: ", source_info)
  )

```
