## Resubmision 2
This is a resubmission to change the name of the package from 'ripums' to 
'ipumsr' and makes related changes within package documentation.

After submitting the package to CRAN, I heard from a group of stakeholders
within our organization that I did not know about before. They feel strongly
that the name should be ipumsr. I understand that CRAN's infrastructure 
discourages name changes, but I have been asked to try to rename the package
anyways.

Thank you for your consideration and I sincerely appologize for any 
inconvenience that this causes.
