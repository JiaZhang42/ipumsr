# Getting Started

The book [R Packages by Hadley Wickham][r-pkg] is a great resource for learning the
mechanics of building an R package and contributing to R packages on github. 
In the meantime, here's a quick beginner's guide on contributing to this project 
using Rstudio:
[r-pkg]: https://r-pkgs.had.co.nz

1) Fork this repo (top right corner button on the github website)

2) Clone the repo from Rstudio's toolbar: 
`File > New Project > From Verson Control > https://github.com/*YOUR_USER_NAME*/ipumsimport/`

3) Make changes to your local copy (don't forget to add your name to NOTICE.txt and 
summarize your change in the NEWS.md file). 

4) Commit your changes and push them to the github webiste using Rstudio's Git pane 
(push using the green up arrow).
